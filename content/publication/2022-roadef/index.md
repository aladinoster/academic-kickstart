# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The growing number of connectivity services in transportation along with a deluge of data collected from different sources, make new control approaches possible to reduce traffic congestion inside urban areas by leveraging V2I (vehicle to infrastructure) communication. Our approach aims at reducing congestion via a (real-time) dynamic rerouting of a fraction of vehicles. The infrastructure broadcasts aggregated speed information for predefined zones, then a cooperative strategy allows the qualification of each zone in terms of traffic performance. This information is then asynchronously used by each of the vehicle agents to determine new paths and achieve their destination. For the sake of scalability, our solution is distributed, using multi-agent interaction and computation based on a framework"
