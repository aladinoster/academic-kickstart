abstract = "The EU SCOOP@F project implements the deployment of these technologies and aims to perform assessment of intelligent systems that enable and promote communication at infrastructure and vehicle technology level in transportation systems. This communication protocol is designed to interact, broadcast and collect messages between participants of a network leveraged by information technologies. In particular, this platform enables vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication and infrastructure to vehicle (V2I â€“ I2V) or vice versa. In this work, we focus on an analysis of different variations of I2V communication policies for speed regulation. In particular, potential effects of regulated speed reduction in time and space are studied."
